A fully spectroscopic hard X-ray imaging detector
The HEXITEC detector measures the energy and position of every photon in the 4-200keV range. Each one of the 80x80 pixels provides a full energy spectrum with an average energy resolution of 800eV FWHM at 60keV.
The GigE 8080 is a self-contained, CE marked module that only requires a mains power supply and connection to a PC or Laptop. It can be supplied with a user friendly GUI to operate the detector and provide calibrated spectra per pixel or industry standard Gig-E-Vision APIs for users to integration into their own systems.
